# Shippex React Native App

This is a React Native app built with **Expo** that features functionalities such as a **splash screen**, **login screen**, and a **main screen** with a **bottom tab navigation**. The main screen includes **Shipments**, **Scan**, **Wallet**, and **Profile** pages.

The project uses the latest **Expo technology** with **Yarn** as the package manager and **TypeScript** for type safety.

## üöÄ Features

- **Animated Splash Screen** using `expo-splash-screen` and `react-native-reanimated`
- **Authentication** screen using `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation
- A main screen with a **bottom tab navigator** containing:
  - **Shipments** screen with filtering options
  - **Scan** and **Wallet** screens
  - **Profile** screen
- Reusable components like **Buttons**, **Input Fields**, **Shipment Cards**, **Filter Modals**, etc.
- State management for user authentication and filtering using **AsyncStorage** and React hooks
- The app works seamlessly on both **iOS** and **Android** using Expo Go.

## üß™ Testing the App

- Test the app directly using **Expo Go** on your device or simulator/emulator.

## üìã Common Commands

- **Start the project**: `yarn start`
- **Run on iOS simulator**: Press `i` in the Expo terminal
- **Run on Android emulator**: Press `a` in the Expo terminal
- **Build production app**: Follow Expo's [build documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/building-standalone-apps/)

## ‚ö° Useful Tips

- If you encounter the error **"Error: TapGestureHandler must be used as a descendant of GestureHandlerRootView"**, ensure you've wrapped your app in `<GestureHandlerRootView>` in the main entry file.
- To resolve the **Reanimated** plugin version mismatch, update `react-native-reanimated` and restart the project.

## üêû Troubleshooting

- **Error: Mismatch between JavaScript code version and Reanimated Babel plugin version**:
  - Run `yarn add react-native-reanimated@latest` and restart the server with `expo r -c`.
